  <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY VARSHA!!!!</h1>
  <h3>Here's a little message from Dhillan!!</h3>
  <p>Dear Varsha,
<br>
Something that really shocks me every single time it crosses my mind is the fact that you can undergo new experiences, meet new people, and create friendships in matters of seconds. The crazy part is that all of this is destined and happens for a reason. The reason why someone could get an A on a test is because they did that one practice question that happened to be on the test. The reason why someone wins a basketball game is because of one good pass. And the reason why I met you is because I needed a ride at homecoming in the middle of the dark. Everything in life seems to fall into place like little puzzle pieces. 
<br>
I got in the car that day having no idea who you were, but something about you from the start was very genuine and wholesome. You only knew me because we had the same friends, but I always picked up positivity from you, even under the awkwardness and laughter of that car ride. I’m not sure what our friendship would be if you didn’t end up giving me a ride that day. 
<br>
Thank you for everything. Seriously. You are a friend who makes an hour feel like a minute. Someone who can light up a dark place, and someone who I vibe with so well that I can’t even explain that in words. Everytime I realize how similar we are it shocks me that we managed to exist at the same time, at the same school, and in the same state. I have never seen someone connect with me musically and emotionally so well until we became friends. I can’t imagine life without a friend like you. I think it’s fair game that everyone needs a Varsha in their life. 
<br>
Anyways, I hope you had an amazing birthday! I cannot wait to make more memories with you, because we’re just getting started. 
<br>
Love,
Dhillan
