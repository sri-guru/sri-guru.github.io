  <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY VARSHA!!!!</h1>
  <h3>Here's a little message from Laasya!!</h3>
  <p>Dear Varsha,                        (DO NOT LET ANYONE READ THIS)
<br>
Ok I literally suck at writing letters or putting my feelings into words that are understandable but I will try my best. Also I am not handwriting this because at a point my handwriting will come to a point where you will not be able to understand it because I will get lazy and my writing will become too messy so I will type this in a handwriting-type font. Anyways, moving on. Varsha, I have known you for around 7 years now since 5th grade. When we had our own little diary between us and Siddhi (when I look back, I cringe so hard but it‚Äôs also funny and cute lmao). Over the years through middle school we faded but we still stayed friends. And then quarantine and junior year happened. And I am so grateful they did. I am so beyond grateful that we became closer because you are one of my closest friends that I will cherish forever. I love your jokes, the way you ask for fries without potatoes, your innocence, the fact you didn‚Äôt know ‚Äúdoing it‚Äù meant having sex (üíÄ), and literally everything about you. You are so adorable and literally anyone that is friends with you is so fortunate to have you in their lives. I love knowing that I can come to you about literally anything and you will always sit there and listen to me and I know you would never judge me (even when I told you about Ryan I was shocked you were so calm about it LMFAO). Thank you so much for being my best friend, sister, therapist, and overall just an amazing person that I can trust. After what I went through last year, you were always there for me and you were always checking up on me and I will forever be thankful because I do not deserve you at all. You are such an amazing person that I can't even describe it in words. YOU‚ÄôRE SO FREAKING CUTE BRO I LITERALLY LOVE YOU SO DAMN MUCH OMFG. Anyways. Literally my most fave memory of us is literally getting ready for any event together, it‚Äôs always so much fun. I love doing your makeup cuz it's so funsies. And I love being your therapist. Thank you so much for trusting me and being confident in ranting to me because when you talk to me about literally anything good or bad, it makes me so happy knowing that you trust me with that information. Ok atp i'm just repeating shit. BUT. CONCLUSION OF THE STORY IS THAT I love you so fucking much that I cant even put it into words because they cannot do justice to how much I care about you. You are an amazing person and literally the bestest bsf I could ever ask for. Thank you for being my bsf and for always being there for me. I will forever be thankful and grateful for you because you deserve it. Happy Birthday Varsha. I hope you have the absolute best year ever because you absolutely fucking desrve it because you are the literal best. I love you so fucking much. You are also legal now which is so slay.
<br>
With so much damn love,<br>
Laasya Brahmandam <3
