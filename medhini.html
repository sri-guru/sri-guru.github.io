  <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY VARSHA!!!!</h1>
  <h3>Here's a little message from Medhini!!</h3>
  <p>Dear Varsha, first of all MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!! Second of all, I truly have no idea how I would survive life in general without you. Not only are you my best friend, but one of the kindest, most compassionate, and unintentionally hilarious people I know. You make my life more exciting and brighten every room you walk into, putting a smile on everyone’s face. From our (way too often) food runs during school to our tik toks to jamming to thangamey every change we get, I cherish every single memory we have made and can’t wait to make more. Thank you for being in my life and making it infinitely better every day. I love u so so so much. - Medhu</p>
