  <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY VARSHA!!!!</h1>
  <h3>Here's a little message from Prisha!!</h3>
  <p>I remember the day we first met up, just the two of us, we talked about our lives to each other as we sat on the swings. Each experience you brought up shocked me because I had gone through something exactly similar. I didn’t want that day to end - I was forcing myself not to think about the time because I was enjoying our conversation so much.<br>
Little did I know that I’d soon be finding any free moments I had to hang out with you, and each time I did, I’d again force myself not to think about the time because I’d get sad thinking about how I’d have to leave you again. It’s weird because I can’t point out a specific day that brought us close together, we sort of just bonded immediately off the bat, like we were meant to find each other at that exact moment. And clearly we were, because I don’t think I’d be here today if I hadn’t met you.<br>
I think about that way more than I should, how weird it is that I met you at the right time, as if the universe meticulously planned out the exact moment in time we needed to meet up - that would end up saving us both. I couldn’t be more grateful that I met you that day. You’re my soulmate, and though it’s so hard to believe that everything I’ve been through you’ve also been through, I find comfort in the thought that somebody understands me in a true, real and raw way. <br>
When shit is happening at home and I don’t know what to do to calm myself down, when I’m sitting on my bed sobbing I find a safe haven, a sanctuary, in you. Because I know I’m not alone, I know you’re at home scared too, or if you're not, you’ve felt what I was feeling in that moment. And that thought gets me through it every single time.I hope you realize how much you’ve helped me by just existing. Seriously, I mean I know that sounds kind of funny but I’m so serious.  When I don’t know how else to calm down, when my anxiety creeps up on me and I can’t breathe and I’m sitting on the bathroom floor all I do is think about you! Or I watch our tiktoks, or I think about how its really funny and incredibly weird that you drink your coffee straight like its water. But I wouldn’t want you any other way! <br>
	You’re not just there for me through the bad, but you’re always there for the good. Every single core memory that comes to my brain immediately, you're in it. The most recent, for example, the day in the parking lot when we blasted music and screamed our hearts out. (felt like therapy!) Or the day we went to Micheals, the last week of school, and made a bunch of stupid tiktoks that I ended up rewatching (reliving through) and laughing hysterically at. Or the day we went to the mall, and how Alter’d Space will always make me laugh any time I see an ad for it or walk past it in the mall. Or the day of Serene and Shomit’s party, when we left to make tiktoks because what else would they expect when they invited us two? Or the day you came over to my house and we just made tiktoks… for hours. <br>
	I couldn't do that with anyone else. I seriously, could not do that with anybody else because it is so incredibly ridiculous and stupid and insanely idiotic that every time we hang out we have to make tiktoks for hours. But I wouldn’t want it any other way because I already know our friendship runs much deeper than that. Even typing this now, it feels weird to say friendship because you mean so much to me that calling you my “friend,” is such a severe understatement it physically hurts. I know you understand that though, because I can’t explain it in words to anybody else without sounding crazy or weird, but you understand. <br>
You just get me, and I just get you, and we don’t need to explain it, because there’s nobody else in this world I would want to feel that with besides you.
<br>
I love you more than your love for coffee and skinned grapes,<br>
Prisha
