  <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY VARSHA!!!!</h1>
  <h3>Here's a little message from Srinidhi!!</h3>
  <p>happy 18 and 2 months birthday varsha !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i really donâ€™t know how to start and how long this is gonna be but weâ€™ll see ig! letâ€™s do the sentimental stuff first and then we can get into the funny stuff :) bruh idk how to write this without being all cringey or cheesyðŸ’€ ok whatever okok i want to start off by jsut saying thank you. thank you for just being there all the time and always knowing how to make me smile. if iâ€™m sad or not feeling good i donâ€™t rly tell anyone about it but sometimes iâ€™ll text you because ik that if i text you no matter how sad or deep the conversation starts somehow i always end up laughing my sss off and i really love that like iâ€™m never stressed texting you and i can just text you freely not having to worry about what i say or overthink my words. it makes me so happy that even though we donâ€™t acc see each other a lot weâ€™re still closer than ever and it just reassures me that in the future we can prolly go for so long without seeing each other and nothing will change. like texting you is like iâ€™m there with you and i can just imagine us laughing to the point where we canâ€™t breathe. i can always count on you to be there and i was reading this letter i wrote to my future self in like 9 grade so like 2 years ago and in it i asked if iâ€™m still friends with ppl from ms and prisha and stuff but for them i was just like i hope i still talk to them but for you i was just like i know iâ€™ll still be talking to varsha. yk like ive never had to worry about our friendship and itâ€™s like the most genuine and fun thing ever like you are really my number 1. and weâ€™ve been with each other through everything like weâ€™ve been friends for 10 years and ofc neither one of us are the same person we were when we first met but weâ€™re also not the same people from a year ago. and i feel like rly often when ur friends w someone snd both of u are dif ppl than when u first met it can get easy to just fade with them bc itâ€™s just not the same it was before and thatâ€™s okay bc people grow apart and inevitably change but with you i feel like i donâ€™t realize weâ€™ve changed until i acc take the time to look back yk? like i feel like weâ€™ve always been like this like with you itâ€™s like we grow and change independently but we donâ€™t grow apart bc of that we actually get closer. like i feel like just in the past 2 years, before quarantine to now our friendship has evolved so much and i love it is fucking much. like idk i tbjnk we never really used to talk about deep things or crushes or life or anything like that like it would be rly fun but it would also be very surface level. but then over the past 2 years i really donâ€™t know how but we have a much stronger bond. iâ€™m like acc so thankful that happened like i faded with everyone else from before 2 years ago EXCEPT YOU BUT UR THE PERSON IVE SEEN THE LEAST IN THAG TIME PROLLY. AND GHFJDKW I THINK THAGS SO AMAZING. like even on the days where itâ€™s so hard to push through i just always know thag i can come to you or talk to you if i need to. and like youâ€™re so genuine and lkke everything but fake yk. like idt i tell you a lot of things that happen whether theyâ€™re good or bad tbh and i think itâ€™s bc iâ€™m so used to telling ppl things NTO YOU NOT YOU but other ppl things and like if itâ€™s good theyâ€™d just be like NICEEE or something sad like it just gets brushed off soemtimes so id just think nobody cares but every time i tell you something good or bad iâ€™m always reminded that you actually care so much. and like if you donâ€™t youâ€™re straight up about it yk like you donâ€™t give some fake ass response and i acc really appreciate thatðŸ˜­ and idk you always match the energy and get so excited with and for me and i really appreciate it. and when i need advice or am sad or something idk youâ€™re always give me good advice or cheer me up and i love you so much omg. ok this is a lot iâ€™m gonna move onto funny stuff nowðŸ’€OK U SEE THAT SKULL EMOJI I LITERALLY DONT USE IT WITH ANYONE EXCEPT UOU OR IF I DO ITS V MINIMAL YK LIKE I FEEL LIKE WHEN IM TALKING TO YOU I CAN ONLY SAY ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ BC U ALWAYS SOMETHING SO FUCKING FUNNY. LIKE UR ONE OF THE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO XAN ACTUALLY MAKE ME GENUINELY LAUGH THROUGH THE PHONE. like if iâ€™m smiling at my phone my mom is always like r u texting varsha ðŸ’€ like itâ€™s always so fun to text you. and i ofc xanr leave this letter without say I LOVE STALKING PEOPLE WITH YOU. LIEK I CAN DO IT SO SHAMELESSLY WITH YOUðŸ’€ðŸ’€AND ITS SO FUBNT BC WE ALWAYS FIND THE CRWZY STUFF. like finding out about sreemanrh and urvi was honestly one of the highlights of the yearðŸ’€ðŸ’€ ITS BROUGHT SM FUN TO US AND THEYRE LITERALLY ACROSS THE WORLD WHICH IS SO BAD BUT ITS OKðŸ’€ðŸ’€ SEE IGE ALRWADY USED ðŸ’€ LIKE A SHIT TON OF YIMESSSS. omg and ykw else when iâ€™m texting u most of the time iâ€™m either like ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ or ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ BC U ALWAYS SAY SOMETHING SO JAW DROPPINGLY SHOCKING AND IM LIKE WTF!?! BUT JTS ALWAYS SO INTERESTINGGGGGG. theres a part of me that misses being in the same school as you but also i really like thatðŸ˜­ itâ€™s like our lives are so separate and so it doesnâ€™t matter if we know things like i can tell u things that i canâ€™t tell anyone else bc theyâ€™re at my school yk? ITS J SO STRESS RELIEVING TO TEXT YOU. tou make me so happy. and youâ€™re acc so ducking funny and sometimes itâ€™s so intentional bc youâ€™ll be with the straightest face across the phone and iâ€™ll be here dying of laughterðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­and i love when we stay up together for so long just TEXTING. TEXTING. like i cannot text people for barley 5 mins BUT ITS SO EASY TO STAY UP UNTIL LIKE 3 TEXTING YOU. ITS LIKE TIME GOES BY TOO FASTTTT. talking to you makes like every problem go away and just puts the world on pause.  i think one of my favorite convos weâ€™ve had is prolly about sreemanth ðŸ’€ like idk just stalking him on instagram and tryna find info about urvi was just so fucking funny and thrilling. and like i remember over the summer like everyday weâ€™d text each other taboht urvis spotify page to see if she changed itðŸ’€ðŸ’€and omg texting u over summer was so fun to me bc yeah we were on different sides of the world but it was like my morning is your night and vice versa and while everyone regular person was asleep you would be awake until like 4ðŸ’€ you just have really real and good energy over text that like nobody else has in my opinion ðŸ’€ you also have like really good style like i havenâ€™t seen u in a while but i have seen ur fits and i rly love them AND IM SK HAPPY U GOT THOSE CONVERSE. i just had to address that. i csnt wait for more stalking and more hilarious memories with you, thereâ€™s never a dull moment. IM SO SCAARED FOR THE FUTURE BUT I FEEL RELIEVED WHEN I REALIZE THAT YOULL ALWYS BE IN IT. i canâ€™t wait to see where u go in the future even if ur anxious or scared abt it, itâ€™s v exciting and omg to me. ok this is rly long so imma stop here ðŸ’€thank you for sticking by me through thick and thin through the good times and the bad and thank you for just being there. i love you more than words can express and i donâ€™t think this paragraph expresses how much i love you but it is already really long so imma end it here. happy fucking birthday i love you so fucking much. u look ur age now!!!!
